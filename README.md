## About 
A Revolut-like mobile application created as a semester project for the "INFT2508 - Cross-platform Applications Development for Mobile Devices" course at NTNU (A.Y. 2024/25), based on [this](https://github.com/ibrahimmemonn/FintechApp) open source template.

## How to run

First run the following command from the root of the project to start Metro:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the root of the project. 
Run the following command to start the app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.
